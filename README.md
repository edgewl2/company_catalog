## Company products catalog
### Part 1

Develop a catalog for a company. Assume that this company sells three different Items. The seller can sell individual items or a combination of any two items. A gift pack is a special combination that contains all three items. Here are some special considerations:
1. If a customer purchases individual items, he does not receive any discount.
1. If a customer purchases a combo pack with two unique items, he gets a `10% discount`.
1. If the customer purchases a gift pack, he gets a `25% discount`.
Write a function for the above scenario. Perform the calculations in code wherever applicable. The function should be your own creation, not copied from any other source.

- Include the following:
  - The code for the function that you created.
  - The Output of the code.
  - A description of what feature(s) your function illustrates.
  - The code and its output must be explained technically. The explanation can be provided before or after the code, or in the form of comments within the code.
